# Chapter1

## Growth
- 1% improvement everyday ,makes you 37 times better in a year, while getting worse 1% everyday will take you back to ZERO.
Compounding works the same way as money. 

- Small changes matter a lot. Results don't come immediately. So, don't slide into bad habits or previous habits. Remember, a small degree shift in the angle makes a larger difference in the direction.

- Focus only on the current trajectory.

- Breakdown a goal into multiple small segments.

## Habits compound!
Examples:
1. Productivity compounds - work on one extra task per day, automate for more time for yourself.
2. Knowledge compounds - one new idea a day
3. Relationships compound 
4. Stress compounds
5. Negative thoughts compound
6. Outrage compound

## Plataeu of latent potential
- There is always a threshold for the results to reflect
Ex - Ice cube, bamboo, earthquake etc..

## Systems >> Goals
- Optimize for the best result. Score takes care of itself.
- Process based. Small consistent improvements. 
- Goals are same for winners or losers. They only give you direction. 
- Survivorship bias - we only concentrate on the people who are winning - the survivors
- Fix the inputs, outputs fix themselves
- Goals restrict your happiness
- Long term thinking >> goals.
- *You do not rise to the level of your goals, but fall to the level of your system!* 

## Changing identities are the fundamental way to change yourself
- Process >> outcomes
- Three levels of change -
    - Outcome change
    - Process change
    - Identity change (most effective)
- Use habits to change beliefs about youself.
- Don't aim for big money, think of yourself as rich instead. Don't aim to exercise daily, instead think of yourself as an athlete. Don't aim to learn a music instrument, think you are a musician instead.
- Habits are the best paths to change identity. 
- Evidence of everyday change. No one-offs. 

1. Decide who you want to be - pinciples and values
2. Prove it to yourseld with small wins
